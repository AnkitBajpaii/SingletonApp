# SingletonApp
A demo project that can be used as a reference to create an application that should have only one instance.
Meaning, if the application is already running and user tries to open one more instance of application , then 2nd instance of application will not be created.
Instead, it will activate the already running application.
This code also shows up splash screen at the time of initial loading.
This code can be used as a reference code while implementing a singleton app and can be customized as per need.
