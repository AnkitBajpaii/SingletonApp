# Looking for a code reference to create only a single instance of your application ?? :runner:
This repository contains a demo project that can be used as a reference to create an application that should have only one instance. Meaning, if the application is already running and user tries to open one more instance of application , then 2nd instance of application will not be created.
Instead, it will activate the already running application.  
This code also shows up splash screen at the time of initial loading.  
<br />
This code can be used as a reference code while implementing a singleton app and can be customized as per need.

Happy Coding :simple_smile:
