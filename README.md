# SingletonApp
A demo project that can be used as a reference to create an application that should have only one instance. Meaning, if the application is already running and user tries to open one more instance of application , then 2nd instance of application will not be created.  Instead, it will activate the already running application. This code can be used as a reference code while implementing a singleton app and can be customized as per need.
